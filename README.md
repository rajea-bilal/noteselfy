# NoteSelfy

![Frontend](./images/signedout-hero.png)

## NoteSelfy is an answer to a problem I faced for many years. 

Its a **web application** that allows users to effortlessly upload screenshots or images, instantly extract the text, and finally put those words to use. Users are able to copy the extracted text, annotate it and share it â€“ bring those words to life! Its a tool to transform those forgotten screenshots into active, accessible knowledge.

It leverages **OCR technology** and **AI-powered categorization** to help users extract and categorize text from images efficiently.

## Features

- Image upload and scanning using **Google Cloud Vision API** for OCR
- Text categorization using **OpenAI's GPT model**
- User authentication via **Clerk** (including Google, GitHub, and Discord sign-in options)
- Personalized user dashboard for viewing and managing uploads
- Image hosting on **Cloudinary**
- Data storage in **PostgreSQL** database hosted on Neon
- Responsive design using **Tailwind CSS**
